# What is a Computer?

## Definition
A computer is an electronic machine that works on data.
It receives data as input, processes it using instructions (software), stores it and produces output as a result.

A computer cannot think on its own. It follows instructions given by humans by software.

## Basic Working Model
Input → Process → Storage → Ouput

## Origin of the Word
The word "computer" is derived from the word "compute", which means to calculate.
Initially, computers were used for heavy and complex calculations.

## Modern Usage
Today, computers are used for various tasks such as:
- Data storage
- Record keeping
- Data manipulation
- Handling large amounts of data
- Performing complicated operations etc.

## Connection to Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity attacks and defenses depend on how a computer receives input, processes it, stores data, and produces output.
Understanding this working model helps in learning how system can be attacked or protected.

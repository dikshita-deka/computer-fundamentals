# Data Vs Information

## What is Data?

Data refers to raw facts or unprocessed details.
It does not have meaning on its own.

Data can be in many forms:
- Text
- Numbers
- Photos
- Videos
- Audio etc.

By itself Data is just input, it does not explain anything.

Example:
25, 28, 31

At this stage, we don't know what these numbers represent.

## What is Information?

Information is processed and organized data that has meaning.

When data is analyzed and given context, it becomes useful.

Example:
25 degrees Celsius, 28 degrees Celsius, 31 degrees Celsius are the temperatures of a city for the next 3 days. 

Now it makes sense.
Now we can understand it.
Now we can take decisions (like planning outdoor activities).

## Key Difference

Data = Raw and unprocessed facts.
Information = Processes data with meaning and context.

A computer processes data to produce information.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity protects both data and information.

If raw data is stolen, it can be processed into valuable information.
That information can be misused.

Protecting data is every stage before and after processing is critical.

## Reflection

Understanding the difference between data and information helps me see how computers create meaning from raw input, why protecting both is imporatnt in Cybersecurity.
